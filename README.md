🔍 SQL Queries
I performed a series of SQL queries to extract insights from a relational database, covering customer behavior, product analysis, sales trends, and operational insights.

Here’s a summary of what I’ve done:

1. Listed the name of each table along with the number of rows it has.

2. Found high-priced products (price > $100.00) and listed their names and prices.

3. Listed all orders placed by customers from Florida (FL), including customer details and order information.

4. Retrieved all products that fall under the categories: 'Computers', 'Toys', or 'Tennis & Racquet'.

5. Identified all products that have not been sold, including their name, category, and department.

6. Listed all cities from where orders were shipped, and for each city, counted the number of delayed shipping orders, sorted from highest to lowest.

7. Counted how many customers are in each segment, showing the most popular segment first, using a column alias.

8. Found the number of orders placed in the first quarter of 2021 using date functions and column alias.

9. Listed all states that support multiple customer segments, in alphabetical order.

10. Found all customers in the Corporate segment who have not placed any orders, including full address info, sorted by last name and first name.

11. Identified customers who purchased the recalled Nike Mens Free 5.0+ Running Shoe, listing their details and ensuring each customer appears only once.

12. Found premium customers (orders > average order amount) and listed their names and order amounts.

In this part, I connected a Python Jupyter Notebook to the SQL database using MySQL connectors and performed the following tasks:

1. Queried and displayed the quantity of items sold per department, sorted by department name.

2. Created a bar chart showing all departments and their respective items sold.

📌 Explained my observations in a Markdown cell.

3. Wrote a query to show the number of orders placed in each year (using YEAR() function).
